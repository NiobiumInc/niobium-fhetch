// FHETCH Simulator — instruction-set simulator for .fhetch trace files.
//
// Reads a FHETCH instruction trace and executes each operation using
// OpenFHE modular arithmetic, producing computed polynomial values
// in memory. This is the functional equivalent of the niobium-compiler's
// FHE_SIM replay target, but operating on the FHETCH text format
// instead of the internal .seq format.
